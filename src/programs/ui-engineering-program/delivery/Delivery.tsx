For example, native apps tend to load all code in advance at the cost of a huge app size. Web apps tend to have smaller initial payload at the cost of more latency during use. How do we choose at which point to introduce latency? How do we optimize our delivery based on the usage patterns? What kind of data would we need for an optimal solution?`}
